# 🔐 IoT Security System with Reinforcement Learning

This is a smart IoT-based home security system that integrates **mobile app controls**, **Raspberry Pi hardware**, **Flask-based AI processing**, and **Reinforcement Learning agents** for intelligent decision-making.

---

## Features
- Mobile App (built with MIT App Inventor)
- Real-time image & sound detection via Raspberry Pi
- Event-based announcements: fire, intrusion, baby cry, etc.
- Flask API for communication & ML processing
- RL agents (Q-Learning, SARSA, DDQN, Bandits) for intelligent decisions
- Fully tested with integration demo
